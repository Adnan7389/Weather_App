# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

A dynamic weather forecast application that allows users to search for weather information by city or location. This project is built using the Visual Crossing Weather API and styled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was guided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as part of a learning journey.

## Features

- üåç **Search by Location**: Enter any city or location to fetch real-time weather data.
- üå°Ô∏è **Weather Details**: Displays temperature, conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
- ‚è≥ **Loading Indicator**: Shows a loading message while fetching data from the API.
- üíª **Responsive Design**: Works across devices, providing a clean and user-friendly interface.
- üîó **Powered by API**: Utilizes the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) for data.

   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Get Your API Key**:

   - Sign up for the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).
   - Replace the placeholder API key in the `script.js` file with your own:
     ```javascript
